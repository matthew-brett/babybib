Check for characters allowed in field names
Here the cite key is fine, but the field name is not allowed:
``You are missing a field name``
@article{2010, 0author="Me"}

Underscores allowed (no error)
@article{2011, _author="Me"}

Not so for spaces obviously (``expecting an '='``)
@article{2012, author name = "Myself"}

Or hashes (``missing a field name``)
@article{2013, #name = "Myself"}

But field names can start with +-.
@article{2014, .name = "Myself"}
@article{2015, +name = "Myself"}
@article{2016, -name = "Myself"}
