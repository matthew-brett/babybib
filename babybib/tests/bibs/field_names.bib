Check for characters allowed in field names
Here the cite key is fine, but the field name is not allowed:
``You are missing a field name``
@article{2010, 0author="Me"}

Underscores allowed (no error)
@article{2011, _author="Me"}

Not so for spaces obviously (``repeated entry``)
@article{2011, author name = "Myself"}

Or hashes
@article{2011, #name = "Myself"}
