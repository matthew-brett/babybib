Strings can only be used after they are defined (gives string name "aname" is
undefined)
@article(Me2009, author=aname)

From section 9 in Beebe (1993)
Strings cannot be empty (raises error, but carries on processing)
@string{}

Left hand side strings can occur on the right hand side
@string{aname = "A Name"}
@string{another_name = aname}

At signs cannot occur in comments
@comment{an @article}

An entry need not have a citation key.  If it doesn't have a comma, the next
entry will be interpreted as the key, even if it does not itself have a comma.
@article{,
    author="me"
}

Concatenation works as expected
@article{Me2011, author=aname # "a string"}

Months are defined by the style, but are defined. With the ``export`` style,
these result in ``export-jan`` and ``export-feb`` for example.
@article{something,
    author=jan,
    title=feb}

String names cannot start with a number (you are missing a string name error)
@string{2thou='two thousand"}

They can contain numbers
@string{t2="two thousand"}

Test article to show the effect of lhs rhs string and t2
@article{Me2010, author=another_name, title=t2}
