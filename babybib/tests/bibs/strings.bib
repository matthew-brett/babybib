Strings can only be used after they are defined (gives string name "aname" is
undefined)
@article(Me2009, author=aname)

From section 9 in Beebe (1993)
Strings cannot be empty (raises error, but carries on processing)
@string{}

Left hand side strings can occur on the right hand side
@string{aname = "A Name"}
@string{another_name = aname}

At signs cannot occur in comments
@comment{an @article}

An entry need not have a citation key.  If it doesn't have a comma, the next
entry will be interpreted as the key, even if it does not itself have a comma.
@article{,
    author="me"
}

Test article to show the effect of lhs rhs string
@article(Me2010, author=another_name)
