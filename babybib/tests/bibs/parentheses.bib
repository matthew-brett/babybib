Testing parentheses; the first comment does not comment out the article
@comment(
@article{Me2010,author="me"}
)
This string works as expected
@string(astring = "one string")
This string raises an error and appears as ``anstring`` below (not replaced)
@string{anstring = (two string)}
@article{Me2009,author=astring,title=anstring}
We can include parantheses in strings as literals
@article(Me2008,
        author="Me ) Again",
        title={Stuff from me})
