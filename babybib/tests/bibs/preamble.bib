@preamble {"This bibliography was generated on \today"}
@preamble ("This bibliography was generated on \today")

Such declarations can be placed anywhere in the document outside entries. If
several of them appears in different places, they are concatenated in the order
of apparition.

The string definition can be used within the preamble so you can have files
such as :

@String {maintainer = "Xavier D\'ecoret"}

@preamble { "Maintained by " # maintainer }

Strings have the usual rules

@preamble { {can also be {nested {deeply }}}}
@preamble { 1999 }
