Both the articles register despite the comment block
@Comment{
@article{Me2010, author="Brett, Matthew", title="An article"}
@article{Me2009,author={Nom de Plume, My}, title="A short story"}
}
These all work OK without errors
@Comment{and more stuff}
@Comment and more stuff
@Comment(and more stuff)
@Comment	and more stuff
@Comment{and more stuff
@Comment(and more stuff
@comment

These all generate errors of parsing
@comment#more stuff
@comment2more stuff
@Commentand more stuff
@Comment+more stuff
@Comment[and more stuff]
@Comment:and more stuff
@Comment"and more stuff"

Last article to show we can get here
@article{Me2011, author="Me really"}
