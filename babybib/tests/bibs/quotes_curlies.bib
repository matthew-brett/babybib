We can't backslash a quote - the name truncates to Matthew \ and gives an error
@article{Me2010,
    author = "Matthew \"Brett",
}
But we can curly it
@article{Me2011,
    author = "Matthew {"}Brett",
}
Can nest quotes in curlies, they are just literals in that case
@article{Me2012,
    author = {Matthew "Brett}
}
Literal curlies are hard - just one literal curly doesn't work - we need open
and closing curlies as here
@article{Me2013,
    author = "Matthew \{ Brett \}"
}
