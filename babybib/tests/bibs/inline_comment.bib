"some text" causes an error like this
``You're missing a field name---line 6 of file bibs/inline_comment.bib``
for all 3 of the % some text occurences below; in each case the parser keeps
what it has up till that point and skips, so that it correctly gets the last
entry.
@article{Me2010,
    author="Brett, Matthew", % some text
    title="An article"}
@article{Me2011,
    author="Brett-like, Matthew",
% some text
    title="Another article"}
@article{Me2012, % some text
    author="Real Brett"}
This one correctly read
@article{Me2013,author={Nom de Plume, My}, title="A short story"}
