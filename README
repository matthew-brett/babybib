A tiny bibliography parser at very early stages of evolution.

I was inspired to do this as part of creating a sphinx extension for bibtex.

My first attempts used bibstuff_ . It began to look as if it would be easier to
implement the bits of bibstuff that I needed.

There are some links to BibTeX format descriptions and software in the
``doc/links_names.inc`` file.
