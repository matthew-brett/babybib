A tiny bibliography parser at very early stages of evolution.

It has a simplified BSD license.

I was inspired to do this as part of creating a sphinx extension for bibtex.

My first attempts used bibstuff_ . It began to look as if it would be easier to
implement the bits of bibstuff that I needed.

After I got a little way, I found pybtex_ .  pybtex_ is much more advanced in
features and maturity.  If you can use the GPL license, I would start there
rather than here.

There are some links to BibTeX format descriptions and software in the
``doc/links_names.inc`` file.
